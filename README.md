## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** html5up template

This was a client project. I met with Saint Stephens Church about their website. Their current website has a lot of text and images about the church and how to join or contact them, but not a lot about their rental hall space. We decided to work together on a simple website with photos of their rental hall and contact information that was designed more for those potential customers. I used the lens template html5up. I added the pictures and text they provided and then hosted the website on Netlify. I then gave them their login for Netlify and the link. 

## Optimizations

Simple website and project for the client. They were happy with it and it does what they asked for. If they ever want it changed or updated they need to reach out to me to help, so in the future I might do this in a way they can be completely self-sufficient. 

## Lessons Learned:

I forgot to change the title in the head of the index.html file. It still says Lens by HTML5 UP. Being one of my first projects, I learned a lot about HTML, using templates, and hosting.
